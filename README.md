# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. It utilizes two datasets: one containing true news and the other containing fake news, both in CSV format. The model is trained on these datasets to classify new news articles as fake or real.

## Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:

- **True News Dataset**: Contains real news articles.
- **Fake News Dataset**: Contains fake news articles.

## Usage

To use the fake news detection model:

1. **Training**: Train the model using the provided datasets.
2. **Prediction**: Provide a new news article, and the model will predict whether it is fake or real.

## Technologies used

The project uses the following Technologies:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
